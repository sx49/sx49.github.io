Hi, I'm Stephanie! This site is still a work-in-progress, but eventually I'd
like for it to be where I can showcase some of my projects and interests.

Some of the things I'm interested in include:

- Computer Science and Tech

   I'm a backend person dabbling in the dark arts of the frontend world. I guess we'll have to see how that goes!

- Games

   I enjoy casual games more than competitive games, so a few of the games I own on Steam include
   Skyrim, Stardew Valley, GTA V, Drawful, and Rocket League (among many others).

- Mushrooms

   The gourmet kind, mind you! In the future, I plan on starting a mushroom farm/mushroom hunting, but
   first I'll stick to learning about them in the Mushrooms and Molds class at Cornell. I'll be sure to
   post about mushrooms on this site because I'm actually in love with them.
